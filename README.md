# Sherlock
This repository contains the front-end, back-end, and the actions of the Sherlock project for detecting suspicious user behaviour.

# Install
We recommend setting up a virtual environment for the project.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is set up, you can install the project dependencies with the following command:
```make install``

# Usage
```python flask_app.py```
This will start the application in the web browser. Open the browser and navigate to the URL http://localhost:5000/
